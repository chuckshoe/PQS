StopWatchFactory.java

01. line 18, wrong indentation.
02. in getStopWatches(), line 51, for reasons mentioned in Effective Java (giving access to own list is not safe) , a new list should have been returned.
03. Some lines, for example 17, 36 have trailing white space
04. line 17, stopwatches should have been made final
05. The Javadoc for getStopwatch() doesn't mention case sensitivity information about id, it would have been better if it was mentioned whether the matching would be case sensitive or not.
06. It would have been better if stopwatches was a Map instead of List as in this case. The reason being that we clearly wanted a unique id for a particular stopwatch, which is better represented by a Map (id being the key, stopwatch being the value). In getStopwatch(), id is checked but Timer object is pushed, it would have been better to have a Timer object corresponding to this is.

Timer.java
01. trailing whitespace in lines 15, 20, 22 etc.
02. toString() is not synchronized, whereas it should have been
03. There shouldn't be line break between declarations eg. between line 19 and 21   
04. lines 23-28, javadoc could be improved and be more specific about the type of string that is allowed and not allowed for id.
05. The javadoc for Timer class could be improved, it doesn't mention the operations supported and that it is a thread safe implementation of Stopwatch
06. In Timer constructor, id.equals("") || id == null) is not needed as it has been checked in StopwatchFactory.java
07. In Timer constructor, there is no need to init primitive variables.
08. In equals(), as mentioned in Effective Java, there are some checks missing, for example, (this == obj) and (!(obj instanceof StopwatchImplementation)).
09. line 42, this keyword not needed and strings should have been compared equals() instead of ==
10. toString() should also print laps
11. hashcode() implementation is incorrect as it uses substring(2), will give same hashcode for this substring id
12. line 65-69, else not required.
13. I don't think getStartTime() and setStartTime() is needed. In my opinion, in a stopwatch only laps are needed.
14. line 113, new list of laptimes should be returned.
15. checking isRunning() is reset is not needed.
16. stop lap doesn't check for the first lap case.
