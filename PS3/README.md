# Production Quality Software - Problem Set 3 (Unit Testing)

## Objectives:
* Write unit tests.
* Perform a code Review
 
## Detailed Requirements
 
You have been provided with a fellow students’ submission. For this assignment 
you’re to write unit tests to verify that the submission meets the assignment 
requirements and to uncover any bugs or ambiguities in the implementation.
 
Eclipse can run JUnit tests without any additional software. To measure code 
coverage you will need to install the EclEmma Ecplise plugin. Your goal in 
this assignment it not only to obtain as much coverage as possible 
but to write clean, effective, and thorough unit tests.
 
If you write any tests that discover bugs please leave the test as is and 
include a comment that explains that the test fails because of a bug in 
the implementation.

 
## Code Review

You have one code review in your project. Please review the code carefully and 
put your comments in the provided file.
